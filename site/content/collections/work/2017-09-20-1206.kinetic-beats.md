  #### How it started
  A friend and I set out to build something that did not yet exist. A personal development project intended to push the boundaries of creative music technology. The Truth is, we figured out what we were building along the way.

  #### My Role
  My role spanned from UX Design to Visual Design to IOS UI development. As the drummer on the project I served as the expert for music concepts and insudtry specific branding. My friend served as beckend devloper and wrote an alogorithm which captures drum beats from thin air.

## The Journey 
Initially, we did not set out to build  an app. Originally we were going to make a small hardware device for virtual drumming. [Freedrum](https://www.freedrum.rocks/) beat us to the punch with a very successful KickStarter campaign for almost the exact product we were devloping. We supported the campaign and wish them well.

Changing our focus a bit, we decided to continue with the air drumming concept, but utilize hardware already built into all iPhones.

We had no app development experience and soon discovered many differences and similarities to building web or desktop applications.

Some geeky details: Sketch, Xcode, Arduino

## The Destination
Play your phone like a drumstick. Record patterns into a looper. Experiment with different drum sounds, time signatures, and loop lengths to create unique beats.
