## Music with motion
A personal development project intended to push the boundaries of IOS music creation. My role went far beyond visual design to IOS development, concept prototyping, experience design, and branding. The inital idea was conceptualized by myself and a friend who became my partner in app crime and beckend devloper.
Some geeky stuff: Sketch, Xcode, Arduino

## The Journey 
This product did not start as an app. Originally we were going to make a small hardware device for virtual drumming. [Freedrum](https://www.freedrum.rocks/) beat us to the punch with a very successful KickStarter campaign for almost the exact product we were devloping. We supported the campaign and wish them well.

Changing our focus a bit, we decided to continue with the air drumming concept, but utilize hardware already built into all iPhones.

We had no app development experience and soon discovered many differences and similarities to building web or desktop applications.

## The Destination
Play your phone like a drumstick. Record patterns into a looper. Experiment with different drum sounds, time signatures, and loop lengths to create unique beats.
